[README File Structure](#readme-file-structure)


Every project repository should contain a `README.md` file.
This is the **front door** to your project. It's the first thing
that a visitor sees when they land on your repository!

The `README.md` serves several purposes:
- **Explain** what the project does
- **Showcases** how to install or run it.
- **Guide** users or contributors on usage
- **Credit** collaborators and specify the licenses
